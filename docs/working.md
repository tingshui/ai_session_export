## Changelog

### 2026-09-08 — Isolated ChatGPT checkpoint ownership

- Added strict ChatGPT-only checkpoint I/O and a dry-run-first state splitter:
  `python -m ai_session_export.chatgpt_state --archive-root /path/to/archive`;
  add `--apply` only after updating all ChatGPT consumers and arranging the
  narrow archive-directory writer workspace. The dedicated checkpoint is
  `chatgpt/.pipeline/export_state.json`; code need not move into that directory.
- The split holds the legacy and dedicated writer locks, preserves the entire
  existing ChatGPT state (generation, message hashes, and Observer handoffs),
  and leaves every other source's JSON value unchanged. A ChatGPT-only hashed
  backup and pending/complete relocation marker make interrupted transitions
  restartable without baseline resets or replaying old receipts.
- Retired ChatGPT entrypoints reject the shared checkpoint before archive
  writes. Other local exporters continue using the shared file, while stale
  state saves cannot erase the relocation marker or resurrect old ChatGPT data.
- No Markdown files, production state, or scheduler configuration are changed
  by installing this code or running the default dry-run command.

### 2026-08-30 — Scheduled producer identity

- ChatGPT apply now records whether a handoff came from manual validation or
  the scheduled automation. The producer trigger participates in the handoff
  run ID, allowing downstream consumers to bind scheduler health to the exact
  scheduled archive run instead of any success from the same day.

### 2026-08-28 — Observer generation handoff

- ChatGPT `apply` now advances a durable `archive_generation` and appends a
  raw-text-free Observer handoff to exporter state, including the prior
  generation, run status, changed archive CAS hashes, exact prior message
  ID/SHA anchor, and exact new user message IDs/SHA hashes.
- Zero-user-delta runs emit an explicit handoff, allowing the downstream
  Observer to advance without reopening Markdown. Handoffs retain a bounded
  generation chain; gaps fail closed into the full-archive recovery path.
- Normal incremental and backfill archives now record `coverage=full_history`;
  only deliberately bounded window previews remain `window_preview`.

### 2026-08-28 — One-time legacy ChatGPT Markdown migration

- Added a dry-run-first legacy importer for the old Project-folder Markdown
  format. It parses emoji user/assistant headings without splitting fenced code,
  assigns deterministic UUIDv5 message identities and SHA-256 turn markers, and
  writes only canonical archives that reread successfully.
- Existing Live archives and checkpoint metadata are validated before planning.
  When a conversation overlaps, duplicate role+content turns are removed from
  the legacy tail and the Live message content, IDs, and output path win.
- Migrated conversations satisfy the downstream `full_history` coverage
  contract; migration source, Live merge status, and approximate-date quality
  remain explicit in the separate `legacy_import` provenance object.
- The apply path updates Markdown, exporter state, and Project indexes as one
  rollback-capable transaction; old conversation files are deleted only after
  verified canonical writes and a successful state checkpoint. Synthetic tests
  cover deterministic parsing, migration, Live precedence, rollback, and exact
  Project allowlisting.

### 2026-08-28

- Added an optional exclusive `--until-at` bound to ChatGPT window plan/apply,
  so a local-day replay can use a precise half-open interval instead of also
  capturing later conversations.

### 2026-08-27

- Added one-time Official seed authority, cross-process ChatGPT writer locking,
  transactional Official archive rollback, and stale Live revision rejection.
- Added complete live-envelope validation, role-specific user/assistant
  completeness, and explicit incomplete-assistant Markdown markers.
- Added an allowlisted ChatGPT Project adapter with two inputs: full-history Codex App snapshots on stdin for daily freshness and official export directories/zips for historical reconciliation.
- ChatGPT terminal stdin disables echo. Incomplete user content fails the
  affected conversation without overwriting its prior archive/state;
  assistant-only truncation remains visibly marked in the private archive.
- Both inputs normalize to the same current-branch `SessionRecord`, stable per-Project Markdown path, per-thread branch fingerprint, and raw-text-free message metadata state.
- Extended the Markdown contract with optional invisible message-ID/content-hash markers. Existing sources emit no marker and preserve their rendered bytes; marker-shaped ChatGPT content is escaped and round-trips through the canonical parser.
- Added exact Project-ID filtering before message parsing, strict official tree/current-node validation, full-pagination proof for live reads, atomic Markdown replacement with reread verification, per-conversation failure isolation, dry-run immutability, and synthetic live/zip parity tests.
- Recorded the Project-scoped archive vocabulary and five user-confirmed architecture decisions in `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`.

### 2026-08-14

- Added the DeepSeek Harness source adapter (`src/ai_session_export/sources/dsh.py`), registered in `sources/__init__.py`, `cli.py`, and `state.py` (`DEFAULT_STATE`).
- DSH sessions live under `~/.dsh/sessions/<workspace-slug>/<session-id>/` as one append-only event log per session, stored as checksummed Zstandard frames (`session.jsonl.zstd`) or plain JSONL. Decompression shells out to the `zstd` binary, keeping the package stdlib-only.
- Discovery globs `*/*/session.jsonl*`: session directory ids are not a single namespace (top-level sessions use `session-<uuid>`, subagent children use bare uuids), so filtering on a name prefix silently loses sessions.
- The adapter keeps `user/message` and `assistant/message` events (final assembled turns; streaming `assistant/chunk` and packed chunk rows are never read), takes titles from the last `session/title` event (LLM-generated titles supersede the fallback), and attributes models per message from `assistant/message` `source` (`provider/model`), with `request/header` as fallback and back-fill for the user turns that triggered each response.
- Dropped subagent-child sessions (header `origin: "subagent"`) and stripped `<system-reminder>` instruction injections from user messages — DSH delivers workspace instructions as user-role messages, and reminder-only messages vanish entirely once stripped. DSH's rendered runtime-context snapshot (`Current runtime context.` prefix, from `renderContextSnapshot` in dsh-system-prompt) arrives as a plain user message with no reminder wrapper and is dropped by prefix match.
- Torn trailing records (interrupted durable batches) are discarded per DSH's own crash-recovery semantics; this includes a truncated final Zstandard frame, which still yields the complete earlier frames on stdout — the adapter treats a nonzero `zstd` exit with partial output as a torn tail, not a failure, and only a fully unusable artifact becomes an isolated retryable failure with a CLI warning.
- Reused the Codex per-session incremental pattern (`latest_timestamp` + `output_file` + `source_mtime_ns`) instead of a global cursor: DSH session files are mutable live logs, and per-session output identity rewrites one stable Markdown file as a session grows instead of minting `_2.md` duplicates. Sessions without any timestamp are skipped (they cannot be placed in the archive), and a session directory holding both physical encodings exports once.
- Added `--dsh-sessions-dir` CLI flag, thirteen synthetic tests (fixture export, growing-session rewrite, subagent skip, reminder drop, compressed path, corrupted-file isolation, bare-uuid discovery, torn compressed tail, source-only model attribution, since-date filter, missing header/header-only skip, both-encodings dedupe, zero-timestamp skip), all-source integration coverage, and a live e2e test. Live run against real data: 7 scanned, 5 exported (one empty session and one subagent child in a bare-uuid directory correctly skipped), full `turn_models` attribution, incremental re-run exported 0.

### 2026-08-12

- Added the Cursor source adapter (`src/ai_session_export/sources/cursor.py`), registered in `sources/__init__.py`, `cli.py`, and `state.py` (`DEFAULT_STATE`).
- Cursor reads the single `state.vscdb` SQLite database: it enumerates composers from `bubbleId:` key prefixes, pulls title/project directory from `composerHeaders`, orders messages by bubble `createdAt`, and keeps only user/assistant bubbles. `modelInfo.modelName` on user bubbles feeds `turn_models` and carries forward to assistant responses.
- Skipped sub-agent composers (`isSubagent = 1`) as agent-to-agent chatter, consistent with the existing noise-drop contract.
- Added `--cursor-db` CLI flag and per-session incremental state (`latest_timestamp` + `output_file`).
- Added synthetic adapter, sub-agent-skip, live, and all-source integration coverage.

### 2026-07-31

- Expanded the single Antigravity adapter to scan Antigravity 2.0, Antigravity IDE, and Antigravity CLI while preserving the stable `source: antigravity` contract and adding optional `surface` provenance.
- Replaced the Antigravity global timestamp cursor with per-surface, per-session source fingerprints, stable output filenames, and parse status. The legacy cursor migrates only the IDE records it historically covered.
- Isolated malformed JSON and wrong-shape JSON to the affected session, retained retryable failure state, surfaced partial failures to the CLI, and kept successful sessions exportable in the same run.
- Treated invalid JSON field types as retryable session failures and kept CLI diagnostics free of session identifiers and local transcript paths.
- Added synthetic coverage for all three surfaces, identical cross-surface session ids, incremental rewrites, malformed-session repair, legacy state migration, mutable-default isolation, and dry-run state immutability.

### 2026-07-25

- Extended the backward-compatible Markdown frontmatter contract with optional `turn_models`, aligned one-to-one with rendered dialogue sections and using `null` for unknown attribution.
- Preserved native OpenCode turn models, assigned Claude user turns from their next assistant response, and tracked Codex turn-context models including delayed context events. Antigravity and Second Mind remain unknown when their exports do not expose model identity.
- Added synthetic renderer and adapter coverage without introducing real transcript data into the public repository.

### 2026-07-15

- Added Codex rollout export from active and archived JSONL sessions, using `session_index.jsonl` for titles and the existing unified Markdown contract.
- Codex keeps only explicit user and agent narrative events; developer instructions, reasoning, tool traffic, token accounting, and world-state records are excluded.
- Added per-session incremental state so active rollouts update one stable Markdown file. Source mtimes avoid reparsing unchanged historical rollouts.
- State writes now use an atomic same-directory replacement, preventing a large Codex state map from being truncated if a process stops mid-write.
- Moved the default output root outside the public repository to `~/.local/share/ai-session-export/` and added gitignore defenses for every generated source directory and state file.
- Added synthetic parser, filtering, incremental-update, and all-source integration coverage.

### 2026-06-29

- Project scaffolded from an earlier prototype and promoted into a standalone, installable package.
- Added the Google Antigravity source adapter (`src/ai_session_export/sources/antigravity.py`), registered in `sources/__init__.py`, `cli.py`, and `state.py` (`DEFAULT_STATE`).
- Antigravity adapter parses `transcript_full.jsonl`, strips the `<USER_REQUEST>` XML wrapper, keeps only `USER_INPUT`/`USER_EXPLICIT` and `PLANNER_RESPONSE`/`MODEL` steps, and drops `CONVERSATION_HISTORY`, `CODE_ACTION`, tool calls, and thinking.
- Added `--antigravity-dir` CLI flag and the `antigravity.last_timestamp` incremental cursor.
- Wrote four source-adapter tests plus a shared fixture builder for the Antigravity transcript shape; full non-live suite is 14 tests passing.
- Added `docs/` with `prd.md`, `rfc.md`, `test.md`, and this file.

## Lessons Learned

- **A product family is not one incremental domain.** Antigravity 2.0, IDE, and CLI use related transcript formats but write independently. A shared maximum timestamp can suppress unseen sessions from another surface; state must be scoped by surface and session.
- **A parse failure is state, not just an exception.** Continuing past one bad transcript is necessary, but marking a partial session complete would make the data loss permanent. Failed fingerprints stay retryable and make cron report partial success explicitly.
- **Legacy cursors encode historical scope.** The old Antigravity cursor represented only the IDE root, so applying it to newly discovered 2.0 or CLI roots would silently discard their history.

- **Session-level model inventories cannot recover turn attribution.** Downstream analytics need an index-aligned `turn_models` contract; `models_used` remains descriptive metadata only.
- **Codex records the same conversation through multiple event channels.** `response_item` mirrors narrative and tool traffic, while `event_msg` provides clean `user_message` and `agent_message` events. Reading both duplicates the transcript; the adapter treats `event_msg` as canonical.
- **Codex rollouts are mutable session files.** A global timestamp cursor creates duplicate `_2.md` files when an active session grows. Per-session output identity is required for incremental correctness.

- **Only `transcript_full.jsonl` is readable.** Antigravity session directories contain several artefacts, including `.pb` files that are binary protobuf with no published schema. Reverse-engineering them is not worth it: the JSONL transcript under `.system_generated/logs/` already contains the full readable dialogue, so it is the only file the adapter needs to touch.
- **The `.system_generated/logs/` directory is created by a recent Antigravity upgrade.** Older sessions on disk were captured before that directory existed, so they have no `transcript_full.jsonl` and are silently skipped by `_iter_transcript_files`. When a user reports "my old Antigravity sessions are missing," the cause is the absence of this directory, not a parsing bug.
- **User intent is wrapped in XML, not bare text.** The `content` of a `USER_INPUT` step is a concatenation of `<USER_REQUEST>...</USER_REQUEST>` and `<ADDITIONAL_METADATA>...</ADDITIONAL_METADATA>` blocks. Exporting the raw content would leak IDE state (active document paths, cursor position, etc.) into the archive, so the adapter must extract only the inner `USER_REQUEST` text.
- **Planner responses are narrative, not tool calls.** A single model turn may carry both a `PLANNER_RESPONSE` step (narrated text, worth keeping) and a `CODE_ACTION` step (the applied edit, not worth keeping) at adjacent `step_index` values. Treating them as separate step types — rather than collapsing them — keeps the archive readable.
- **Second Mind cannot be cursor'd by timestamp.** Its export JSON does not expose a reliable per-conversation timestamp, so the incremental cursor is a plain count of conversations already seen. This is fragile if the export file is regenerated in a different order; `--full` is the escape hatch.

- **Cursor composer ids are not a single namespace.** The ids in `bubbleId:` keys and the ids in `composerHeaders` overlap but do not match exactly: some composers have bubbles but no header row, and some header rows have no bubbles. The bubbles are the authoritative record, so enumeration must start from the key prefixes and treat the header table as optional metadata.
- **DSH session directory ids are not a single namespace either.** Top-level sessions use `session-<uuid>` directories, but subagent children materialize under bare uuids. A discovery glob keyed on the `session-` prefix returned 6 of 7 real files with no warning — the same failure class as the Cursor bubble/header split, caught only by diffing directory listings against parsed headers.
- **DSH duplicates user speech through two channels.** `agent/inbox/spliced` mirrors user input around turn boundaries and `assistant/chunk`/packed chunk rows mirror the streaming transcript. Reading either duplicates the archive; only the canonical `user/message` and assembled `assistant/message` events carry the dialogue.
- **DSH injects workspace instructions as user messages.** The `<system-reminder>` wrapper arrives as a regular `user/message` event, so a naive export turns injected AGENTS.md content into phantom user turns. Stripping the wrapper before the empty-text check drops reminder-only messages entirely while preserving user text that merely sits beside a reminder. The runtime-context snapshot is a second injection class with no wrapper; its stable `Current runtime context.` prefix (generated by dsh-system-prompt) is the filter anchor.
- **Per-message model beats session-sparse request context.** Real DSH logs carry one `request/header` per multi-turn session but tag every `assistant/message` with `source.{provider, model}`. Attributing from the request header alone leaves later user turns `null` in `turn_models`; the per-message source back-fills every turn.
- **A torn Zstandard frame still streams its complete prefix.** `zstd -d -c` exits nonzero on a truncated final frame after emitting the earlier frames' bytes. `check=True` turned the realistic crash state into a permanent export failure; tolerating nonzero-with-output preserves the durable prefix, and only zero-output corruption stays a retryable failure.
